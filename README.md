# Build Dynamo Packages Like a Pro
## From zero to hero the (*not so*) easy way

If you are reading this document, is because my class has been accepted at Autodesk University 2024, you have decided to enrol, and you want to know more about building Dynamo packages.

Yes, at the time of writing, I still don‚Äôt know if the class will be accepted or not, but considering the complexity of the topic, the amount of information I need to write, and with an history of preparing the hands-out at the last minute, this year I have decided to dedicate the right amount of time.

We will talk about setting up the right projects combination to build dynamo node using the zero touch library, dynamo nodes with custom UI, dynamo extensions/view extension, and wrap everything together in a single package.

We will use [Nuke Build](https://nuke.build/) to automate the process of building, compiling, packaging and deploying the too

This year I have also decided to write the document in a more interactive and dynamic way, so I can embed `code`, üìΩÔ∏èvideos, üñºÔ∏èimages, etc.
